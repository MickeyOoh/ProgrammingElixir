A module that declares that it implements a particular behaviour must implement all of the associated functions. If it doesn't, Elixir will generate a compilation warning.\n", "\n", "A behavior is therefore a little like an _interface_ in Java. A module uses it to decalre that it implements a particular interface.\n", "For example, an OTP GenServer should implement a standard set of callbacks(*handle_all,handle_cast,* and so on). By declaring that our module implements that behaviour, we let the compiler validate that we have actually supplied the necessary interface. This reduces the chance of an unexpected runtime error.\n", "\n", "### Defining Behaviours\n", "We define a behaviour using the Elixir *Behaviour* module, combined with *defcallback* definitions.\n", "\n", "For example, Elixir comes with a URI parsing library.
